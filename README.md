## Selected Publications

### [*Expanding the Meditron Protocol â€“ Cross-Family Adaptation, Safety and Conversational Capabilities in Generative Medical Decision Support Systems* (Master's Thesis 2025)](https://github.com/ETKZ/my-website/blob/master/MScThesis_EtienneBoisson_MeditronExpansion.pdf)
We enhance the safety, ethics, instruction-following, and conversation capabilities of Meditron LLMs through fine-tuning, synthetic data training, and evaluation. The Meditron Protocol is adapted across multiple foundation models on a robust infrastructure.

### [*Llama-3-Meditron: An Open-Weight Suite of Medical LLMs* (OpenReview)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZcD35zKujO)  
We introduce Llama-3-Meditron, a high-performing open-weight suite of medical large language models (LLMs) built on LLaMA-3.1 (8B and 70B).

### [*GPoet: A Language Model Trained for Rhyme Generation on Synthetic Data* (ACL Anthology)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.latechclfl-1.2)  
We propose a novel solution for rhyme generation using synthetic data created with a rule-based rhyming algorithm.
